### Those programs mainly taiked about how to change the pixel value of the pictures.

The main code is saved in the **second_demo.cpp** and the **second_demo1.cpp**, and the config files consists the head file **gdal_priv.h**, the source file **gdal_i.lib**, the dynamic link library **gdal18.dll** and the picture **test.jpg**. you can use these files to run the program on the **visual studio 2017**. 

The source picture of those programs:

The result of **second_demo.cpp** just like this:

The result of the **second_demo1.cpp** just like this:

we have changed two parts of the picture to white and black.

### Some problems in the process of doing the test

+ How can we change a lot of parts's pixel value at the same time?    Make users to input the location  of  parts they want to change.  just like the **"please enter the origin, the length and the width of the parts"**.
